# Mentor-Mentee_Software

OVERWVIEW:
A matchmaking software using data gathered from Google Forms &amp; Sheets to pair up mentees with mentors in the Student Support Services program at Binghamton University

HOW IT WORKS:
Users complete the forms listed in the directory online on Google directly. After the necessary deadline is reached and / or the amount of data is gathered, the forms are closed off and saved directly to .csv files and saved in the directory where the program files are located. There is a script.sh that can be run using 'sh script.sh' in the Terminal to build and start the program. When the program has started, it will prompt the user to upload a file for the MENTORS and the MENTEES. The program will run and produce a Results.txt file that will show the results of the program. The Results.txt will show all the mentees and a list of mentors that matches best with each of them.
